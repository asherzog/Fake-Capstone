# DropSchedule
DropSchedule is a desktop application made using Electron as a wrapper for an Angular web app with a Node/Express/MongoDB backend. It is a business tool made specifically for an oil and gas company in Denver, CO, but the key components of the application are transferable to many industries. The application links together key metrics associated with the scheduling of new oil wells and allows for seamless rescheduling while dynamically updating water forecasts based on the schedule. It uses Chart.js to create interactive graphs and charts for visually appealing representations of the data.
